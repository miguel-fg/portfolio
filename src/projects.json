    "description": "This project aims to create a Braille printer using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, OpenCV, and Tesseract. The printer captures a snapshot of text, extracts the characters using optical character recognition (OCR), and translates each character into movement instructions for three motors. These motors generate a strip of paper with corresponding Braille tactile bumps."
